# 🧮 1D Random Walk Simulator & Central Limit Theorem Demo

![Random Walk Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alibijari/alibijari/main/assets/randomwalk_banner.png) <!-- Optional: add your own banner or remove this line -->

## 🚀 Overview

This project provides a modern, well-documented Python code to **simulate the 1D random walk (binomial walk)** and demonstrates the emergence of the **Central Limit Theorem** (CLT) in statistical physics. It includes interactive visualizations and a comprehensive LaTeX lesson, making it ideal for students and educators in computational or statistical physics.

## 📦 Features

- **Simulate**: Generates both a single random walk path and a large ensemble of independent walks.
- **Visualize**: Plots the random walk trajectory, histogram of local time (position visits), and the final position distribution for many walkers.
- **Compare**: Overlays empirical results with the theoretical Gaussian distribution predicted by the CLT.
- **Document**: Includes a detailed, LaTeX-friendly lesson explaining the mathematical model, code logic, and physical significance.
- **Educational**: Perfect for labs, classroom demonstrations, or self-study in physics, math, or data science.
